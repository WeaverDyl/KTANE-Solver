# KTANE-Solver

This project is a program that will solve any module in the base game of [Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes](http://www.keeptalkinggame.com/), which is available on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/341800/Keep_Talking_and_Nobody_Explodes/). 

## Preface

You really shouldn't use this. I wrote this to learn more Python, but this program will ruin the fun of the game. Please use the [bomb manual](http://www.bombmanual.com/) to defuse bombs.

## How to Use

To run this program, simply call ```python main.py``` in a terminal, and follow the directions. It's that simple.
